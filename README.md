## Background

CoreText, part of Appleâ€™s text rendering system, has exhibited a memory retention issue when handling emoji characters in keyboard extensions, which can lead to increased memory usage. While this issue may not impact most iOS applications, it poses significant challenges in custom third-party keyboard extensions.

After extensive debugging, the presented solution minimizes this memory impact, providing a practical example for iOS developers working on keyboard extensions.

This repository provides a sample project showcasing a solution for a persistent memory issue in iOS keyboard extensions, specifically related to CoreText's handling of emoji rendering. The problem, affecting iOS keyboard extensions since 2014, is addressed here with in-depth debugging insights and a unique fix implemented in Swift.
